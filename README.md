# UTS_Model_Deployment
This project serves as my midterm assignment for model deployment. It features a loan status prediction app that determines whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

The app is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed here: https://octavius-sandriago-uts-model-deployment.streamlit.app
